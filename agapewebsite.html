		We are a group of people simply walking through life together! <br>
		Our mission is to embody Agape Love (Highest Form of Love) and through it, we reach out to students at Texas A&M and share the good news of the Gospel with them. <br>
		As Agape, we believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior who has died on the cross so that we are fully justified of our sins and through Him, we are purified; therefore, we do our best to live righteously under God’s eyes. <br>
		We meet every Friday at 6:30pm at people’s houses around the College Station/Bryan Area to share meals, discuss the Word of God, and have fellowship. <br>
		All are welcome to visit, check out, and even join one of our (currently) two house churches. We love everyone and we are willing to meet you where you are! If you are interested in knowing more about us, or if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact one of the leaders! <br>
		Agape love involves faithfulness, commitment, and an act of the will. <br>
		<i>agape</i> (agapē): "the highest form of love, charity"
