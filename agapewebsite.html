<!-- POSSIBLY CHANGE ALL THE <p> TO <br> -->
	<p> We are a group of people simply walking through life together!</p>
	<p> Our mission is to embody Agape Love (Highest Form of Love) and through it, we reach out to students at Texas A&M and share the good news of the Gospel with them. </p>
	<p> As Agape, we believe that Jesus Christ is our Lord and Savior who has died on the cross so that we are fully justified of our sins and through Him, we are purified; therefore, we do our best to 		live righteously under God’s eyes. </p>
	<p> We meet every Friday at 6:30pm at people’s houses around the College Station/Bryan Area to share meals, discuss the Word of God, and have fellowship. </p>
	<p> All are welcome to visit, check out, and even join one of our (currently) two house churches. We love everyone and we are willing to meet you where you are! </p>
 	<p> If you are interested in knowing more about us, or if you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact one of the leaders! </p>
	<p> Agape love involves faithfulness, commitment, and an act of the will. </p>
	<p> <i>agape</i> (agapē): "the highest form of love, charity" </p>
